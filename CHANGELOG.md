## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

## [1.2023.0] - 2023-01-18

* The date-style versioning used by this crate is now
  (`v1.YYYY.SEQUENCE`), where `1` indicates the current API version,
  `YYYY` is the current year, and `SEQUENCE` is an increasing sequence number
  for the year. This was changed to prevent versions that would otherwise
  be illegal in the crate ecosystem, like `v1.2023.0117`.
